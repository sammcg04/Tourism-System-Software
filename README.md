# Tourism-System-Software
We were required to make the software system for a tourism website with the following brief:
The customer has come to you with a vague specification. In this project you are required to:
1. You must elicit a substantial set of software requirements from them in the form of User
Stories (10 User Stories should be created).
2. The User Stories should then be translated into formal descriptions/models that can be
used by all project stakeholders, most importantly the developers and testers. These
models would include a complete set of UML diagrams: Use Case, Sequence Diagram,
Class Diagram and Architecture Diagram.
3. A mock-up of the user interface should be produced.
4. Additionally, an outline set of System tests that can be used to validate the User
requirements should be created.
Each project is to be completed by a team of three people. It is up to your team to imagine the
problem scenarios that a customer might expect your software to solve. A report no more than
15 pages in length (including Parts 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the project â€“ detailed above) should be
produced with the relevant diagrams and explanatory text. In addition to this, the team should
generate a 2-minute video presentation detailing their report. Also, the contribution of each
member to the report should be clear in the report and the contribution of each member to the
presentation should be clear in the presentation.
